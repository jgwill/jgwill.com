## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How is this different from Creative Commons?**
A: Creative Commons assumes individual ownership that can be given away. IKSL recognizes knowledge as belonging to relationships and land, with communities as stewards rather than owners.

**Q: Can I fork this repository?**
A: Technical elements can be forked under CC BY-SA. Sacred elements require permission and proper protocols.

**Q: How do I contribute back?**
A: Document your contributions in the metadata, share improvements with the community, and consider how your work serves the seven generations to come.

**Q: What if I violate the license accidentally?**
A: Reach out immediately. This license emphasizes restoration over punishment. Honest mistakes can become learning opportunities.
